# FRIDAY
Spotlight alike for windows

This is a prototype. All it can do is run a search on tureng.com (Turkish-English dictionary)

1-> "Alt + 1" brings FRIDAY
2-> Type any word
3-> Hit return
4-> Search result opens in browser

If you hit "Alt + 1" while the FRIDAY was visible, she will disappear. That hotkey basically toggles the visibility.

I can, in future, turn this into a full Spotlight copy and even more.
